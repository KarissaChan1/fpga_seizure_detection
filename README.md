FPGA implementation of seizure detection algorithm (migrated from old GitHub account, last updated 2020). Codes written as part of research project at the Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Laboratory at the University of Toronto for an on-chip proof-of-concept for seizure detection.

MATLAB folder includes experimental/dev .m scripts and data. VITIS folder includes C++ scripts for FPGA implementation (custom IPs).
